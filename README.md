# [ðŸ“ˆ Live Status](https://FogSwim.github.io/xfar-uptime): <!--live status--> **ðŸŸ© All systems operational**

<!--start: d-->

**Upptime** (https://upptime.js.org) is the open-source uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by GitHub Actions, Issues, and Pages. It's made with ðŸ’š by your friends at [Koj](https://koj.co).

> I find Upptime an incredible clever usage of \[GitHub Actions]. You essentially get a free configurable uptime monitor for whatever you want. â€“ [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/upptime/)

Upptime is used by [**1,000+**](https://github.com/topics/upptime) people and teams to ensure they know when their endpoints go down.
